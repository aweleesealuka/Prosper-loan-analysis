# Prosper Loan Data Analysis
## by Awele Esealuka


## Dataset

The Prosper loan dataset comprises of 113937 loan entries with 81 attributes on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others, from the year 2009-2014.


## Summary of Findings

I observed that borrower rate had the strongest(although moderate) correlations with credit score, loan amount and monthly loan payment, all negative. Among the non-numeric variables, I observed that borrowers with lower borrower rates were those who earned more, had good Prosper Ratings and low Prosper scores(borrower risk). I will be including these in my presentation. Also, borrowers with shorter loan terms, are home owners and are employed also had lower borrower rates, I will not be including these in my presentation.

Moving on to loan amount, the trends that were observed in borrower rate were also observed, the higher the loan amount, the lower borrower rate. Borrowers with good Prosper rating, good credit rating and low Prosper score received more high value loans, those who earn more also. I will include these in my presentation. 

The average loan amount showed an upward trend over the years, and for the average borrower rate, there was an increase in the average rate from 2009 to 2011, then a slight decrease from 2011 to 2012 and then a sharp decline from 2012 to 2014.
In states where borrowers had higher income, they also borrowed higher amounts, same with low income states.
## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on just the influence of the Prosper rating, Prosper score, Credit score, and monthly income on loan amount and borrower rate, as well as whether the borrower is a home owner or not. I start by introducing my main variables of interest(loan amount and borrower rate), by plotting their distributions.

Afterwards, I introduce each of the categorical variables one by one. I use scatter plots, violin plots and bar charts to show how these variables relate with my variables of interest.
